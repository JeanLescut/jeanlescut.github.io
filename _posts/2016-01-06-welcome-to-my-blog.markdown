Welcome to my blog ! This is my piece of web that will handle several topics... that I can't enumerate for sure at the moment...

#### Data-sience and technologies

I love technology & data-science (it's my job). I will certainly write a lot about it, either to express an opinion, to share a project, or to present technical solution that I couldn't find elsewhere on the web (the community on the web appeared to be very helpful to me... so I certainly owe that)

#### Music, "drum things", travels & miscellaneous

Again, the goal is sharing experience. During my (little) free time I play music in a band as a drumer, and during my (big) free time I really love to travel in the Europe/world.

### Why doing it on a blog ?

Simply in two lines :

1. To get my own, independent "piece of the web"
2. To reach the maximum number of you, people

I surely could write a post on Facebook or Linkedin but it would have been sadly limited to my personnal contacts...
I also could write articles on a forum or platform like reddit, but I wouldn't have got as much liberty I'm enjoying with my blog.

I also have to mention a particulary skillful (former) workmate, [Yin Jin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yjin88/fr), that created [his own blog](http://jinyi.me/) and a [cloud-based data lab](http://lab.jinyi.me/). He unintentionally triggered the construction of this blog : I'm humbly following his tracks.

## Why in English ?

I'm French but I will write every post in English, despite I'm aware that :
- on one hand a lot of French people won't appreciate it, most likely because of we care a lot about our language and culture.
- on the other hand some English-speaking readers will suffer a lot from numerous spelling and grammar mistakes. (I'm really, really sorry about that) 
The reason is, as I said before, that I don't want to take away the majority of the world, on the grounds that they cannot read a language spoken by 1% of the world's population.

## What's next ?

In the next section, I will start by explaining why I chose a static-website builder to host my blog, and why Jekyll and github-pages in particular. I will also write about another project of mine : buidling its own cloud-based services and remote-computer using docker on top of a VPS. For the other posts... well we'll see.
