Following the tracks of a particulary skillful (former) workmate, Yin Jin, that created [his own blog][yi-blog] and [Cloud-based data lab][yi-lab], here I come with the ambition of sharing my own experience!

I'm French but I will write every post in English, despite I'm totally aware that :
- on one hand a lot of French people won't appreciate it because of the attachment we got about our language, culture and so on. 
- on the other hand some English-speaking readers will suffer a lot from numerous spelling and grammar mistakes. (really, really, sorry about that) 
The reason is, as I said before, that I don't want to take away the majority of the world on the grounds that they cannot read a language spoken by 

I will start by explaining why I chose Jekyll and github-pages to host my blog, then how to choose its VPS hosting service and finally I will describe how to create his own remote-computer using docker on top of the VPS.
