In this first post, I'm gonna try to explain why I've just created all this, just in case you wonder, and because I'm convinced it's curcial to formalize the purpose of a project before anything else.

## Why a blog ?

### Something to say/write ?

#### Data-sience and technologies
Ok, I love technology & data-science, and it's by the way my job, and most of the times things go smoothly during mathematical modeling or vizualisation. But I sometimes have to struggle, facing a troublesome question. In this case, the community on the web often prove to be helpful, but again sometimes I must figure a solution out on my own :

  - either because I can't find any relevant tutorial (or past experience description) on the internet, 
  - or because the tutorial I'm following is simply not working in my case. 

Which naturally brought me to share my own solutions and modest opinions about products out there. About that section, my goal is simply to save time and avoid pain for some readers (at least one, I hope) of this blog.

#### Music, "drum things", travels & miscellaneous
Again, the goal is sharing experience to help others, as others helped me a lot with their own experience. During my (little) free time I play music in a band as a drumer, and during my (big) free time I **love** traveliing the Europe/world.
The idea is here to provide another point of view about some culture or destination to travellers.

### Why doing it on a blog ?
Simply in two lines :

1. To get my own, independent "piece of the web"
2. To reach the maximum number of you, people.

I surely could write a post on Facebook or Linkedin but it would have been sadly limited to my personnal contacts...
I also could write articles on a forum or platform like reddit, but I wouldn't have got as much liberty I'm enjoying with my blog.

I also have to mention a particulary skillful (former) workmate, [Yin Jin][yi-linkedin], that created [his own blog][yi-blog] and a [cloud-based data lab][yi-lab]. He unintentionally triggered the construction of this blog : I'm humbly following his tracks with the purpose of sharing my own experience!

## Why in English ?
I'm French but I will write every post in English, despite I'm totally aware that :
- on one hand a lot of French people won't appreciate it, most likely because of we care a lot about our language and culture.
- on the other hand some English-speaking readers will suffer a lot from numerous spelling and grammar mistakes. (I'm really, really sorry about that) 
The reason is, as I said before, that I don't want to take away the majority of the world, on the grounds that they cannot read a [language spoken by 1% of the world's population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers).

## Can you explain in details how did you do that ?

In the next section, I will start by explaining why I chose a static-website builder to host my blog, and why Jekyll and github-pages in particular. I will also write about another project of mine : buidling its own cloud-based services and remote-computer using docker on top of a VPS.
