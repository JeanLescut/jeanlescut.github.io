# Welcome to my blog !

Following the tracks of a particulary skillful (former) workmate, Yin Jin, that created [his own blog][yi-blog] and a [cloud-based data lab][yi-lab], here I come with the purpose of sharing my own experience!

## Why a blog ?
### Something to say/write ?

#### Data-sience and technologies
Ok, I love technology & data-science, and it's by the way my job, and most of the times things go smoothly during mathematical modeling or vizualisation. But I sometimes have to struggle, facing a troublesome question. In this case, the community on the web often prove to be helpful, but again sometimes I must figure a solution out on my own :

  - either because I can't find any relevant tutorial (or past experience description) on the internet, 
  - or because the tutorial I'm following is simply not working in my case. 

Which naturally brought me to share my own solutions and modest opinions about products out there. About that section, my goal is simply to save time and avoid pain for some readers (at least one, I hope) of this blog.

#### Music, "drum things", travels & miscellaneous
Again, the goal is sharing experience to help others, as others helped me a lot with their own experience. During my (little) free time I play music in a band as a drumer, and during my (big) free time I **love** traveliing the Europe/world.
The idea is here to provide another point of view about some culture or destination to travellers.

### Why doing it on a blog ?

1. To have my own "piece of the web" on whic
2. To reach the maximum number of you, people.

I surely could write a post on Facebook or Linkedin but 
## Why in English ?
I'm French but I will write every post in English, despite I'm totally aware that :
- on one hand a lot of French people won't appreciate it because of the attachment we got about our language, culture and so on. 
- on the other hand some English-speaking readers will suffer a lot from numerous spelling and grammar mistakes. (really, really, sorry about that) 
The reason is, as I said before, that I don't want to take away the majority of the world on the grounds that they cannot read a language spoken by 

## Can you explain in details how did you do that ?

I will start by explaining why I chose Jekyll and github-pages to host my blog, then how to choose its VPS hosting service and finally I will describe how to create his own remote-computer using docker on top of the VPS.
