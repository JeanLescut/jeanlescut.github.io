title: How to fully initialize a Data Science server
---

I shared a bunch of scripts aimed at :
- Cleansing the server from some useless service that you may not be using
- Installing basic admin tool on the server, like `sudo` or `tmux`
- Generating a valid, signed & **free** HTTPS certificate, just to get a nice green "https" logo on top of your browser ;)
- Installing Nginx for reverse proxy, for getting URL address like https://yoursite.com/jupyterhub/ ...
- Installing Jupyter (even Jupyterhub for several users), formerly known as iPython Notebook, and Python 3 Anaconda
- Installing RStudio server, and IDE running on top of R Revolution

All my scripts are documented and available here

Thanks for reading ;)
