This topic is not proper to my sector of activity (Consulting) and you certainly have your own opinion about it. You may argue that competing against each other is just life, and that challenging is a efficient driver of skill improvement. In contrary, you could just not accept the idea, or are skeptical about it, like me.

## Passion and skills leads to ambitions

And naturally (even hopefully) every employee has his/her own ambition, own projects, own path to their ideal future. The employees know their value on the market 

## Ambitions lead to competition.

Or I should write : Ambitions lead to an awkward internal competition ? 

# Competition for recognition : a stimulus or a break for productivity?
