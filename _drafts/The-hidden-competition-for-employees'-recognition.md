# The what and the root causes

## Passion leads to skills

I truly believe that I'm working with some of the most skillful data scientists in France. We are young for the most, recently graduated from prestigious universities around the world, and the majority of my coworkers seems to have unified, if I can say, the statistical and the algorithmic considerations of Data Science. Above all, we all are immersed in a culture of an endless curiosity that incites us to attend [meet-up](http://www.meetup.com/), read papers, watch [MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/), debate among us (and others), and experiment bad-ass technologies on our own !

## Passion and skills leads to ambitions

And naturally (even hopefully) every employee has his/her own ambition, own projects, own path to their ideal future. The employees know their value on the market 

## Ambitions lead to competition.

Or I should write : Ambitions lead to an awkward internal competition ? 

# Competition for recognition : a stimulus or a break for productivity?

# Competition for recognition :
## A stimulus for skills improvement

## A break for productivity

### The more your colleagues communicate, the less your manager watch

### The less your manager watch, the more you have to communicate

### The more you have to communicate, the less you can achieve


"It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit."
